        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>This project visualises data related to traffic offences collected from Australian government sources. The dataset includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speeding fines</strong> reported by state transport and road safety departments.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile phone use while driving</strong> violations obtained from police enforcement records.</li>
          <li><strong>State-level demographic context</strong> integrated from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for age group comparisons.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="info-card">
        <h2>Data Collection Methods</h2>
        <p>Traffic offence data is collected through both manual and automated enforcement mechanisms. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Police-issued fines:</strong> Officers manually record offences such as mobile phone use, speeding, and dangerous behaviour.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed and mobile detection cameras:</strong> Devices placed on roads to capture speeding and phone violations automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Red light and mobile phone detection systems:</strong> Used increasingly in urban areas to catch distracted driving.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The dataset includes information on which detection method was used for each offence.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="info-card">
        <h2>Data Coverage and Updates</h2>
        <p>The dataset spans from <strong>2008 to 2023</strong> and is updated annually. Each record includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Year of offence</strong></li>
          <li><strong>State or territory where the offence occurred</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Detection method</strong> (Police or Camera)</li>
          <li><strong>Fine amount and count</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Offender’s age group</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This allows for trend analysis over time, comparison between jurisdictions, and insights into enforcement strategies.</p>

        <h2>How the Dashboard Uses the Data</h2>
        <p>The dashboard provides two main views — one for <strong>Speed Fines</strong> and one for <strong>Mobile Phone Use</strong>. Users can explore the data interactively using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Year slider</strong> to view fines in a specific year.</li>
          <li><strong>Checkbox filters</strong> to include or exclude detection methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Age group buttons</strong> to compare behaviour across demographic segments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Visualisations include pie charts, bar charts, line charts, choropleth maps, and detailed summary tables. These update in real time based on the selected filters.</p>
